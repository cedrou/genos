#summary Presentation and motivation

= Codename: Genesis =

GenOS is an experimental managed operating system. It is the result of a personal challenge, which is to create a new OS and, in parallel, to describe in a blog each steps of the development (first ideas, technology choices, wrong ways, ...).

The sources of this project are maintained here on Google Code and the blog is at http://genos.blog.free.fr.

Because of the specificity of this project, there is no clear specification at the moment.
They'll be define as needed.
