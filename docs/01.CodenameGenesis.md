# Codename: Genesis

This is the first post of this new blog which aims to describe day after days the genesis of a new operating system.

To start, let me introduce myself. My name is Cedric Rousseau, I'm a 32 years old french developer and i've mainly coded since 10 years in C++ under Windows. I've started .NET and C# language in the first half 2006. I live near Paris and until now, I didn't wrote a lot of documents in english, so please be indulgent - English is not my mother tongue! I am married and have two (soon three) wonderful children. I work as software engineer for a start-up specialized in microelectronic. So the time that I reserve to work on this project will be probably reduced and not constant.

This project is really a challenge for me and it consists on creating a new operating system and describing in parallel what I am currently coding and all the choices that I am taking. Many developments will probably lead to a dead-end. Many other will start as "quick and dirty" code and will be enhance later. The aim is not to create a revolutionary OS to kill the good ol' Windows/OSX/Linux. Take it as an exercise. I only expect that this blog will help a lot of developers.
